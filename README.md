# First-Discord-Bot
This is my first ever discord bot. It is a text-based game where you have to put the correct ingredients to make a cake. I made it as a gift for my friend Epraksia and it only works if she or I type the command. 

The zip file contains everything (all code files, images, data). You can also see just the code I wrote and images I made in the other uploaded files. If you open the CLASS and GRADLE files using a text editor, you can see the code. For obvious reasons, I did not upload the token file.

I used:
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 15.0.1 version
- Java Discord API (JDA) wrapper 4.2.0 version
- IntelliJ IDE
- a gradle shadow plugin by John R Engelman 6.1.0 version
